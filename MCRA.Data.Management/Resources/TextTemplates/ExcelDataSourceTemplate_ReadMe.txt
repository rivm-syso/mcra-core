MCRA Excel dataset template [TableGroup]

This Excel file is an empty template of an MCRA compliant dataset for [TableGroup]. MCRA datasets are composed of one or more relational tables describing the data. Depending on the type of data, some tables may be required and others may be optional. For some types of data, multiple ways of formatting are available, each with way with its own particular requirements. For a detailed description of the data format for [TableGroup], go to:

https://mcra.rivm.nl/Mcra91/WebApp/manual/modules/[ModuleClassId]-modules/[ModuleId]/[ModuleId]-data-formats.html#consumptions-data-formats

In the Excel format, each data table is specified in a separate sheet. The names of the sheets should comply with the accepted table names of the module(s) for which the data is intended. The table fields must follow the data table formats of the intended modules.

You can use this empty template to format own data to upload and use it in MCRA. This can be done by simply adding the data in the worksheets of this document. You can delete the worksheet of the tables that are not needed/required. Also, columns that are not required may be removed from the tables. When ready, the resulting XLSX file can be uploaded to MCRA, which should recognize it as a valid data file containing [TableGroup].
