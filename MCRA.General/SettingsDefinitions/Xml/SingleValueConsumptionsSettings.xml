    <Name>Use standardised consumption distributions before calculation of single values</Name>
    <Description>
      Specifies whether single values are calculated on individual consumptions standardised with body weight
      and then multiplied by the mean body weight. Otherwise, single values are calculated on the original consumptions
      (per day). Note that both methods lead to different estimates for the single value.
