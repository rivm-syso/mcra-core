      <Description>
        Exposures are multiplied by the RPF and thus exposures to different substances are on the same and comparable scale.

      <Description>
        All substances are standardised to equal variance (selection of the components will work on patterns of correlation only).

      <Name>Unstandardised (RPFs = 1)</Name>
      <ShortName>ExposuresUW</ShortName>
      <Description>
        Exposures as such are taken (unstandardised). This is equivalent to RPFs equal to 1. Thus exposures to different substances are not on the same and comparable scale anymore.
