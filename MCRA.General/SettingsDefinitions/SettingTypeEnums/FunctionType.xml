      <Description>
        A polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of the independent variable (e.g. age) and the corresponding conditional mean of y (here the exposure). A polynomial with a degree of 0 is simply a constant function; with a degree of 1 is a line; with a degree of 2 is a quadratic; with a degree of 3 is a cubic, and so on.

        A spline fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of the independent variable (e.g. age) and the corresponding conditional mean of y (here the exposure). A spline with a degree of 0 is simply a constant function; with a degree of 1 is a line; with a degree of 2 is a quadratic; with a degree of 3 is a cubic, and so on.
