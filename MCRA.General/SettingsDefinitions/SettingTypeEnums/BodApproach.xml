      <Description>
        Top-down approach starting with an estimate of the total burden in the population. A population attributable fraction (PAF) is calculated by
        applying an exposure response function (ERF) along with observed exposures, thereby estimating the proportion of the overall burden
        attributable to the chemical exposure. The attributable burden follows from multiplication of the total burden by the PAF.

      <Description>
        Bottom-up approach starting either by estimating the number of new or excess cases based on observed exposures and the exposure
        response function (ERF), or by evaluating the expected shift in individual responses (e.g. changes in IQ) resulting from exposure.
        These are translated into a burden measure â€“ often by multiplying by factors such as duration and disability weight (or a monetary value)
        to calculate the attributable BoD for indicators like DALYs.
