  <Description>
    Unit variability factors specify the variation in concentrations between single units of the same food, which have been put together in a mixture sample on which the concentration measurements have been made.
    Unit variability factors are used to account for the fact that concentration data often relate to composite samples, whereas an acute risk may result from single food units.
