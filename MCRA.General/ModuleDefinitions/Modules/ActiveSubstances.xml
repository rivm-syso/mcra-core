  <Description>
    Active substances are substances that may lead (P>0) to a specific health effect (adverse outcome).
    Active substances are specified directly as data or calculated from POD presence, QSAR models or Molecular docking models.
    Active substances can have an assessment group membership 1 (crisp), or values in the range (0,1] (probabilistic).

  <ShortDescription>
    Active substances are the substances that may lead (P>0) to a specific health effect (adverse outcome).
  </ShortDescription>
  <DataDescription>
    When provided as data, in the form of assessment group memberships, the active substances are derived from the specified memberships.
  </DataDescription>
  <CalculationDescription>
    Active substances and assessment group memberships may be computed from PoD presence of in-silico data.
