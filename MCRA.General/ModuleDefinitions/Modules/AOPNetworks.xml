  <Description>
    Effects are related to each other using the toxicological concept of adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) and adverse outcome pathway networks (see https://aopwiki.org).
    Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) Networks specify how biological events (effects) can lead to an adverse outcome (AO) in a qualitative way through relations of upstream and downstream key events (KEs), starting from molecular initiating events (MIEs).
    Using AOPs, the adverse outcome (AO), e.g., liver steatosis, is linked to key events (KEs), e.g., triglyceride accumulation in the liver, and to molecular initiating events (MIEs), e.g., PPAR-alpha receptor antagonism. In general, multiple AOPs may lead to the same AO, and therefore AOP networks can be identified.

  <DataDescription>
    AOP networks can only be provided as data in the form of network definitions containing effect relations (key-event relationships) collections.
