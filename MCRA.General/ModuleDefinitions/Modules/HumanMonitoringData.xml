    Human (bio)monitoring data quantify substance concentrations found in humans.
  </ShortDescription>
  <DataDescription>
    Data are provided in the form of surveys consisting of individuals from which the human monitoring samples taken.
    Substance concentration measurements are linked to analyses performed on the human monitoring samples.
    The data should also include information about the analytical methods that were used.
