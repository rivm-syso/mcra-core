  <Description>
    Internal doses and concentrations are amounts of substances, typically expressed per mass unit and per day, to which individuals in a population are exposed at the chosen target level.
    This target level is an internal dose or an internal concentration (expressed per unit [organ] weight). Internal exposures may be aggregated from dietary and non-dietary exposures using
    either absorption factors for systemic doses or kinetic conversion factors or PBK models to translate the external exposures to internal concentrations at the specific target or tissue.
    Internal exposures can be short-term/acute exposures and then contain exposures for individual-days, or they can be long-term/chronic exposures, in which case they represent the average
    exposure per day over an unspecified longer time period.

  <ShortDescription>
    Internal exposures are amounts of substances, typically expressed per mass unit and per day, to which individuals in a population are exposed at an internal level. The internal amount is specified as a internal dose,
    i.c. the absorbed dose is the amount of chemical that is systemically avaiable and can be regarded as the fraction of the external dose taht is absorbed and enters the general circulation.
    Or, the internal amount is specified as a internal concentration, i.c. the amount of chemical present in a specific target or tissue. See also WHO, Principles and methods for the risk assessment of
    chemicals in food, Environmental health criteria 240.
  </ShortDescription>
  <CalculationDescription>
    Internal exposures are computed by linking dietary and (if available) non-dietary individual/individual-day exposures. The (aggregated) internal exposure is computed as an internal concentration
    at the specified target compartment using kinetic conversion factors or PBK models or as an internal dose that is systemically available in the general circulation using absorption factors.
