  <Description>
    Concentrations data are analytical measurements of chemical substances occurring in food samples.
    In their simplest form, concentration data can just be used as provided by datasets.
    Optionally, concentrations data can be manipulated for active substances, extrapolated to other foods, and/or default values can be added for water.

  <ShortDescription>
    Concentration data are data on analytical measurements of chemical substances occurring in food samples.
  </ShortDescription>
  <DataDescription>
    Concentration data can be entered using the internal, relational data format or using the EFSA SSD format.
    Depending on the settings, the entered concentration data can be pre-processed for conversion to active substances, extrapolation to other foods, and/or default values can be added for water.
