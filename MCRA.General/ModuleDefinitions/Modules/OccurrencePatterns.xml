  <Description>
    Occurrence patterns (OPs) are the combinations (or mixtures) of substances that occur together on foods and the
    frequencies of these mixtures occurring per food, expressed in percentages.
    In the context of pesticides, occurrence patterns are associated with agricultural use percentages.
    Occurrence patterns are relevant to account for co-occurrence of active substances in exposed individuals.
    Occurrence patterns may be specified as data or modelled based on observed patterns of positive concentrations.

  <DataDescription>
    Occurrence patterns are provided as data by specification of the occurrence mixtures and their associated
    occurrence/agricultural use percentages.
  </DataDescription>
  <CalculationDescription>
    Occurrence patterns are computed from the observed patterns of positive concentrations in the concentration data.
