  <Description>
    Human monitoring concentrations are substance concentration estimates for a biological matrix (e.g., urine or blood) derived from data obtained from human monitoring studies.

  <CalculationDescription>
    Human monitoring concentration estimates are computed from data obtained from human monitoring studies. These concentration estimates are computed per substance for a selected (human) biological matrix. Modelling includes imputation of missing values and non-detects, but also correction of concentrations for, e.g., specific gravity.
    Occasionally, the number of substances measured on the target biological matrix is limited or to low to perform a risk assessment or mixture analysis. If so, matrix conversion is applied: substances measured on other biological matrices are translated to the target matrix after multiplication with a 'between matrix conversion' factor.
    Cumulative risks of multiple substances are calculated using RPFs weighted exposure or using the sum of risk ratio's method using hazard characterisations.
