  <Description>
    Human monitoring concentrations are substance concentration estimates for a biological matrix (e.g., urine or blood) derived from data obtained from human monitoring studies.
  </Description>
  <CalculationDescription>
    Human monitoring concentration estimates are computed from data collected in human monitoring studies. These concentration estimates are computed per substance for a selected (human) biological matrix. Modelling includes imputation of missing values and non-detects, as well as correction of concentrations for, e.g., specific gravity.
    Occasionally, the number of substances measured in the biological matrix of interest is limited or too low to perform a risk assessment or mixture analysis. In such cases, matrix conversion can be applied: substance concentrations measured in other biological matrices are translated to the matrix of interest using a kinetic conversion factor.
    Cumulative risks of multiple substances are calculated either by using RPFs weighted exposure or by using the sum of risk ratios method using hazard characterisations.
