  <Description>
    Processing factors are multiplication factors to derive the concentration in a processed food from the concentration in an unprocessed food and can be specified for identified processing types (e.g., cooking, washing, drying).
    Processing factors are primarily used in dietary exposure assessments to correct for the effect of processing on substance concentrations in dietary exposure calculations.
