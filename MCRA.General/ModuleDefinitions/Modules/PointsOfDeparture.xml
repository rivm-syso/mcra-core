  <Description>
    Externally specified points of departure can be used as an alternative to calculated BMDs from dose response models.
    Points of departure can be of various types, such as NOAEL, LOAEL or BMD.
    They can be used to construct the list of active substances, to derive relative potency factors, and to perform health impact assessments.
