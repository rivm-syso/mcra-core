  <Description>
    Substances are chemical entities that can refer to: 1) active substances such as investigated in toxicology; 2) measured substances such as defined in specific analytical methods.
    MCRA assessments can have one or more substances as the scope.
    When more than one substance is specified, there is an option to perform a cumulative assessment.
    In that case one of the substances has to be indicated as the index/reference substance, and results will be expressed in equivalents of the index substance.
