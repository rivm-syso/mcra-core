  <Description>
    Consumptions by modelled food are consumptions of individuals expressed on the level of the foods for which concentration data are available (i.e., the modelled-foods).
    These are calculated from consumptions of foods-as-eaten and food conversions that link the foods-as-eaten amounts to modelled-foods amounts.
