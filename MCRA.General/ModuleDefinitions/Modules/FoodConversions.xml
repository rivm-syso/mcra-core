  <Description>
    Food conversions relate foods-as-eaten, as found in the consumption data, to modelled foods (foods-as-measured), which are the foods for which concentration data are available.
    A food-as-eaten can be linked to one, or multiple modelled foods using various conversion steps (e.g., using food recipes to translate a composite food into its ingredients).
    There are several types of conversion steps, and a conversion path may comprise multiple conversion steps between a food-as-eaten and a modelled food.

  </ShortDescription>
  <CalculationDescription>
    Food conversions are computed recursively, starting with a food-as-eaten and following a path to ingredients (food recipes), super/sup-type foods, etc. until either arriving at a modelled food (commonly the raw primary commodity) or concluding that the path does not lead to a modelled food.
