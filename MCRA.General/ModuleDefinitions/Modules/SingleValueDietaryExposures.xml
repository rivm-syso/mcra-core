  <Description>
    Single value dietary exposures are based on the single value concentrations of substances, expressed per standard (kg) bodyweight and/or single value amounts of consumed modelled food.
    Depending on the exposure type, dietary exposures can be short-term/acute exposures.
  </Description>
  <ShortDescription>
    Single value dietary exposures are based on the single value substance concentrations and single value consumption amounts in a population exposed from the diet per day.
  </ShortDescription>
  <CalculationDescription>
    Single value dietary exposures are calculated from single value consumptions per modelled food and single value concentrations.
    Optionally, also processing factors, unit variability models and use frequencies are applied.
