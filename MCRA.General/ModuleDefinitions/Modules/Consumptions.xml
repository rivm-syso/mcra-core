  <Description>
    Consumptions data are the amounts of foods consumed on specific days by individuals in a food consumption survey.
    For acute exposure assessments, the interest is in a population of person-days, so one day per individual may be sufficient.
    For chronic exposure assessments, the interest is in a population of persons, so preferably two or more days per individual are needed.
